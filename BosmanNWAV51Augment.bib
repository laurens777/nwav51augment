@article{Kaisse1982,
   abstract = {This paper investigates five rules of Modern Greek which delete or desyllabify vowels without causing deletion of the stress that the vowels bore. It is suggested that stress behaves much like tone under deletion, and that an autosegmental representation of stress can, with some modification, account for its preservation. The syntagmatic nature of stress, as opposed to tone, is then discussed and shown to account for some otherwise arbitrary restrictions on the deletion of vowels. Finally, the historical development of Modern Greek past tenses is analysed in terms of the emergence of a 'stress melody' parallel to the tone melodies that mark morphological categories in many tone languages.},

@article{Ralli2019,
   abstract = {Περίληψη This paper investigates the realizations of the unaccented syllabic augment (SA) in the speech of Greeks who emigrated to Canada from 1945 to 1975. The dataset was constructed from recorded interviews with 131 speakers from Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Regina, and Montreal as part of the ImmiGrec project (https://immigrec.com/en). The participants are bi-dialectal speakers of both Standard Modern Greek (SMG) and a dialect variety of Modern Greek, and they represent not only regions where SA seems to be retained (for example, Crete) but also regions where it is thought to have disappeared (for example Northern Greece). Our data reflect the variability that has characterized this phenomenon since the initial observation of Triandaphyllidis (1936) that SA was not obligatory in the vernacular of his era. We find that the unaccented SA is still present in areas where it would be expected according to the relevant literature (e.g. Chios, Crete and Ionian Islands), but with some indications of retreat. In contrast, speakers who come from areas where the unaccented SA is not retained (e.g. regions of Northern Greece and Lesbos), sometimes use it in their speech. We suggest that there are two possible reasons for this: The prestige that Peloponnesian has over other dialects, because of its great similarity with SMG, and the effect of the new social networks into which the participants were integrated in their new communities in Canada.},

   abstract = {The present paper is a contribution to the study of a new Modern Greek variety that is spoken in Canada by first-generation immigrants who arrived in this country between 1945 and 1975. This variety displays features originating from: (a) A Common Modern Greek spoken in Greece around the middle of the 20th century, (b) mutually intelligible characteristics of the immigrants’ native dialectal varieties, mainly from the Peloponnese, (c) contact with English, (d) Standard Modern Greek. We present, discuss, and analyze data collected within the framework of the project “ImmiGrec: Stories of Greek immigration in Canada.” We focus on linguistic elements that could be considered indicative features of a Greek-Canadian Koiné, more particularly by investigating the borrowing and integration of English nouns and the variation in the use of the unstressed syllabic augment /e-/ and two different imperfective past suffixes.},
